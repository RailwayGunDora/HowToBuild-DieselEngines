  <h1 style="color: white;"> How To Build A Diesel Engine</h1>
  <hr size="3" noshade>
  <br>
  <p1 style="color: white;">The First thing that should come to mind when building a mechanical device is the <em> materials </em>you wish to use, most of
    us choose to use whatever we find in our backyards or at the dumpster. But in this case, we have to use certified materials that
    will ensure maximum safety at all times.</p1>
  <br>


  <p2 style="color: white;">The concept of a Diesel Engine has been around for a very long time but we're not gonna entertain it's history for now.

  <h3 style="color: white;">The List of materials is Included below</h3>
  <!---Bullet Points--->
  <ul>
    <li style="color: white;"> <strong>Graphite cast iron (CGI), A viable alternative to gray cast iron for the manufacture of diesel engine blocks.
        Like magnesium alloys, this material offers a higher strength and lower weight than gray cast iron.</strong></li>
    <li style="color: white;"> <strong style="color :lime;">Aluminium Iron</strong> for the pistons and piston rings</li>
    <li style="color: white;"> <strong style="color :red;">Steel and Cast Iron</strong> for the Camshaft and Crankshaft</li>
  </ul>

        <p3 align=centre style="color: white;"> The Diesel Engine also works in 4 cycles just like a normal Petrol(Gasoline) but the only difference is that
          a diesel unlike petrol engine uses no spark plugs. Diesel engines rely purely on compression for ignition of fuel.

          <h3> <strong style=color :Lime;">But, What is a diesel engine?</strong></h3>

          Like a gasoline engine, a diesel engine is a type of internal combustion engine. Combustion is another word for burning, and internal means inside, so an internal combustion engine is simply one where the fuel is burned inside the main
          part of the engine (the cylinders) where power is produced. That's very different from an external combustion engine such as those used by old-fashioned steam locomotives. In a steam engine, there's a big fire at one end of a boiler that
          heats water to make steam. The steam flows down long tubes to a cylinder at the opposite end of the boiler where it pushes a piston back and forth to move the wheels. This is external combustion because the fire is outside the cylinder
          (indeed, typically 6-7 meters or 20-30ft away). In a gasoline or diesel engine, the fuel burns inside the cylinders themselves. Internal combustion wastes much less energy because the heat doesn't have to flow from where it's produced into
          the cylinder: everything happens in the same place. That's why internal combustion engines are more efficient than external combustion engines (they produce more energy from the same volume of fuel).
          <br>
          <h3> <strong style=color :red;">How is a diesel engine different from a gasoline engine?</strong></h3>
          Gasoline engines and diesel engines both work by internal combustion, but in slightly different ways. In a gasoline engine, fuel and air is injected into small metal cylinders. A piston compresses (squeezes) the mixture, making it
          explosive, and a small electric spark from a sparking plug sets fire to it. That makes the mixture explode, generating power that pushes the piston down the cylinder and (through the crankshaft and gears) turns the wheels. You can read
          more about this and watch a simple animation of how it works in our article on car engines.
          <br>
          <strong style=color :lime;"> Diesel engines</strong> are similar, but simpler. First, air is allowed into the cylinder and the piston compresses it—but much more than in a gasoline engine. In a gasoline engine, the fuel-air mixture is
          compressed to about a tenth of its
          original volume. But in a diesel engine, the air is compressed by anything from 14 to 25 times. If you've ever pumped up a bicycle tire, you'll have felt the pump getting hotter in your hands the longer you used it. That's because
          compressing a gas generates heat. Imagine, then, how much heat is generated by forcing air into 14–25 times less space than it normally takes up. So much heat, as it happens, that the air gets really hot—usually at least 500°C (1000°F) and
          sometimes very much hotter. Once the air is compressed, a mist of fuel is sprayed into the cylinder typically (in a modern engine) by an electronic fuel-injection system, which works a bit like a sophisticated aerosol can. (The amount of
          fuel injected varies, depending on how much power the driver wants the engine to produce.) The air is so hot that the fuel instantly ignites and explodes without any need for a spark plug. This controlled explosion makes the piston push
          back out of the cylinder, producing the power that drives the vehicle or machine in which the engine is mounted. When the piston goes back into the cylinder, the exhaust gases are pushed out through an exhaust valve and, the process
          repeats itself—hundreds or thousands of times a minute!
